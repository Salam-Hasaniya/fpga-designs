#ECE 4310 / Vivado Projects  
### by Salam Hasaniya  

This repository contains all of my **FPGA design and hardware description language (HDL)** work completed throughout the **Vivado-based digital systems course** at Cal Poly Pomona.  
Each lab focuses on learning a new concept in **Verilog**, **hardware interfacing**, and **FPGA system design** using the **Xilinx Vivado Design Suite** and **Nexys A7** development board.  

---

##Overview
These projects explore core digital design principles such as:
- Combinational and sequential logic design  
- Timing control and clock division  
- Memory-based lookup systems  
- FIFO buffering and data flow control  
- Peripheral I/O using LEDs, switches, and potentiometers  
- Signal generation and real-time pattern visualization  
- Integration of keyboard, mouse, and analog inputs
