Lab 1: Barrel Shifter

Barrel Shifter
A input
y output
Shift Amount

Parameterization
instead of 8 bit we have 2^N bits
amt should be N
instead of 3 stages should be N stages
for parameters we need to look at generate, for FOR loops

First is Left shifter
Test Bench
also test bench left shifter and right shifter at same time
2nd is right shifter with left right control and a multiplexer to show desired output
Show on FPGA
3rd is left/right generic shifter where you dont use mux but you use two reversers
Show on FPGA
